# Hey there! 

this is just a demo repo of me trying to set up a minimalist 
blogging system. 
[Moreinfo about my rant here](https://github.com/TrevCan/trevcan.github.io/blob/fc6f193f9bd8650497513253b0dbfc5a3f54c270/_posts/2021-11-06-idk-learn-pedantics-blogit.md)

I'm using *pedantic*'s software: [`blogit`](https://pedantic.software/git/blogit). 
It doesn't have a license. Literally. So yeah

# getting started
to get started on learning how to use blogit, 
- clone the repo (https://pedantic.software/git/blogit).
- run `man -l blogit.1` inside the repo directory. That should get you
	started
	
	
# todo
[x] add `.redirect[.new]` functionality (only missing .new funcitonality)
[x] improve docs in this readme and main non-[features]
