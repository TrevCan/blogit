this is a title!

All articles are stored under the articles/ dir

and the filename can be anything ending with `.md`.

Also, you do not have to specify the date anywhere in your articles,
blogit will automatically find it for you based on the date you
committed the file. That is, 
**files that are not tracked by git will not be compiled!** 
nice feature, right ?
